## Introduction

Jungle is a full-stack Amazon-inspired clone. Whether a logged-in user or otherwise, you are able to view items and the comments on each item. As a logged-in user, you are also able to comment on items, as well as being able to create your own items, and manage them.

Flask, SQL Alchemy, AWS S3, POSTGRESQL, and Docker were used to create the database and backend routes.

Routes used with Flask for:

Hosting is managed by Render.

## Frontend Technology
